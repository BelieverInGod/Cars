Armstrong is a lightweight modular CSS framework written in SASS. It is designed to be none invasive to help you out at the start but not be a nightmare when you want to add your own look and feel (like certain other frameworks...)

## Structure & Modules

Armstrong is designed to be fully modular. If you dont need something, like tables for example, just dont include it! 

Below is a breakdown of the structure


```
style/
└── armstrong/
    ├── modules/
    │   ├── _base.scss
    │   ├── _buttons.scss
    │   ├── _cards.scss
    │   ├── _fonts.scss
    │   ├── _forms.scss
    │   ├── _grid.scss
    │   ├── _dialog.scss
    │   ├── _helpers.scss
    │   ├── _lists.scss
    │   ├── _mixins.scss
    │   ├── _normalize.scss
    │   ├── _navigation.scss
    │   ├── _scaffold.scss
    │   ├── _progress.scss
    │   ├── _settings.scss
    │   ├── _tables.scss
    │   └── _typography.scss
    ├── armstrong.scss
    └── armstrong.css	
```

#### _base.scss

The raw essentials for armstrong. I wouldn't reccomend removing this or anything it imports or you're gonna have a bad time. Includes the grid, fontawesome and some basic, sensible, hip & happening defaults.

#### _buttons.scss

Self explanatory really. Adds some plain sensible cross browser defaults for button controls. This includes button and submit. The out of the box classes are 'positive' and 'negative', which are green and red respectively.

#### _cards.scss

Everything needed for the card layouts.

#### _fonts.scss

Overides base font with one from Google Fonts (open sans by default). Change this file for an easy way to change your sites global font.

#### _grid.scss

This file is imported by bicep (via _base) as a mandatory import. It provides a flexible grid based layout for your site. The new version uses flexbox, so make sure you're not targeting old browsers

#### _lists.scss

Handy for bootstrapping of linear lists.

#### _mixins.scss

This file is used by various files across armstrong. Nothing exciting here!

#### _normalize.scss

This file is imported by armstrong as a mandatory import. It is just the latest from [normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

#### _scaffold.scss

This provides some defaults for layout out pages. Strongly reccomended if you want to use headers and footers (sticky or otherwise) without any hassle.

#### _settings.scss

Provides base settings for all the rest of armstrong. You can change these if you want, but it's better just to override later yourself if you want to.

#### _progress.scss

New in V2! Gives you a nice spinner along with a determinate/indeterminate progress bar.

#### _navigation.scss

New in V2! If you use a nav with some a tags, you'll get a nice looking nav without any messing about.

#### _dialog.scss

New in V2! All you need to show pure css dialogs. Again, made for minimal hassle.

#### _tables.scss

Again, self explanatory. Provides some less hideuos defaults for tables cross browser.

#### _typography.scss

This gives you some nice defaults for typography elements (p, span, code, h1, h2, h3, .date, .author etc)


## Customization

To customize Armstrong, you just need to crack open the armstrong.scss file and comment/remove the modules you dont need. For example here is the default with all the dumbbells and whistles

```scss
// REQUIRED IMPORTS
@import "modules/base";

// OPTIONAL IMPORTS
@import "modules/fonts";
@import "modules/typography";
@import "modules/forms";
@import "modules/tables";
@import "modules/lists";
@import "modules/buttons";
@import "modules/cards";
```

And here is it configured without tables or cards

```scss
// REQUIRED IMPORTS
@import "modules/base";

// OPTIONAL IMPORTS
@import "modules/fonts";
@import "modules/typography";
@import "modules/forms";
//@import "modules/tables";
@import "modules/lists";
@import "modules/buttons";
//@import "modules/cards";
```

Just be sure never to remove the `modules/base`, import or again, you're gonna have a bad time.

## Third party components
Armstrong uses a couple of amazing components from other authors
- Font Awesome by [Dave Gandy](http://fontawesome.io)
- Normalize.css by [Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/), co-created with [Jonathan Neal](http://music.thewikies.com/jonneal/).

Huge thanks to these guys for writing libraries I could not live without :)
